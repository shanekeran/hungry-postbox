## Testing the User Stories

### Site User

<details><summary>Access the website from any device and easily navigate the website regardless of screen size.</summary>

- The website was created with a mobile first design that scales up to any device size. For example, the collapse navigation bar makes it easier to get around on smaller devices. </details>

<details><summary>Be able to easily read all content and view all images displayed.</summary>

- All images and fonts increase / decrease in size based on screen size.
- Buttons increase in size when hovered over.
- Images contain alt tags in the event that they don't display.

</details>

<details><summary>Create an account with a profile that is customised with my own information and picture.</summary>

- Users are able to register for an account if they provide all the required information.
- Users can personalise their profiles with descriptions about themselves, unique usernames and a profile picture of their choosing.

<details><summary>Freely edit my profile and if necessary delete my account with ease.</summary>

- Users can edit their profiles from within their profile page without the need for the site owner to assist.
- Users can edit everything they originally entered into the registration form and this new information will be updated.
- Users can also delete their profiles from their profile page. Defensive programming was used to turn this into a 2 step process so users don't accidently delete their account.
