# Hungry Postbox
<i>Connect with people across the globe through handwritten letters</i>

Hungry Postbox is a full-stack application that allows site users to create an account and discover other users who are interested in communicating via handwritten letters. Hungry Postbox is taking social media messaging offline and back to more traditional methods. The website can be viewed on any device while still maintaining its simple, easy to use design.

## User Experience (UX)
___
### Overview

I used user stories and the five planes of user experience design as a framework for planning the project.

### User Stories

*As a site user, I want to*

- Access the website from any device and easily navigate the website regardless of screen size.
- Be able to easily read all content and view all images displayed.
- Create an account with a profile that is customised with my own information and picture.
- Freely edit my profile and if necessary delete my account with ease.
- Contact other members who I would like to become pen pals with and likewise for them to be able to contact me.
- My account password to be securely stored to prevent any unauthorised access to my account.
