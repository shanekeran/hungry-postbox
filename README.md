# Hungry Postbox
<i>Connect with people across the globe through handwritten letters</i>

Hungry Postbox is a full-stack application that allows site users to create an account and discover other users who are interested in communicating via handwritten letters. Hungry Postbox is taking social media messaging offline and back to more traditional methods. The website can be viewed on any device while still maintaining its simple, easy to use design.

## User Experience (UX)
___
### Overview

I used user stories and the five planes of user experience design as a framework for planning the project.

### User Stories

*As a site user, I want to*

- Access the website from any device and easily navigate the website regardless of screen size.
- Be able to easily read all content and view all images displayed.
- Create an account with a profile that is customised with my own information and picture.
- Freely edit my profile and if necessary delete my account with ease.
- Contact other members who I would like to become pen pals with and likewise for them to be able to contact me.
- My account password to be securely stored to prevent any unauthorised access to my account.

* As a site owner, I want to*

- Provide a platform for users who to find new pen pals.
- Promote my brand throughout the site, including links to our social media accounts.
- Provide clarity to the user on the purpose of the website.
- Allow users to independently create, edit and delete their accounts without the need to contact the site owner.
- Display visual feedback to the user based on actions they take on the website.


### Strategy


The purpose of the website is to allow users to discover members of the site who are interested in communicating offline through letter writing. The target market of Hungry Postbox is not limited by age but it does focus on people who are either looking from a break from conventional social media or those who could never understand it in the first place.

After reviewing competitor websites, I noted that the main pen pal websites are outdated in design and hide many features behind pay walls. Even with these downsides, they still have new users signing up eevryday and a very active community. My aim with Hungry Postbox is to offer a simple, free to use, modern simplistic design to fill my percieved gap in the market.

The strategy for the project is to implement the needs previously outlined in the user stories and to also meet the business goals.

The first business goal which the website must fulfil is to increase brand awareness of the Hungry Postbox brand. This can be achieved by displaying a large logo on the home page and smaller logos in the navigation and footer of each page. Users will be able to follow our other social media accounts through links in the footer of each page, allowing them to connect with us further if they wish.
The second business goal is to continually grow the userbase through website signups. This can be achieved by strategically placing CTA buttons on the home page to intice new visitors to register an account with us.
